# PDF-LLM

## Project Description
PDF-LLM is a Streamlit-based web application that allows users to upload PDF files and ask questions about their content. The application uses OpenAI's language model and MongoDB for chat message history storage to provide accurate and context-aware responses.

## Features
- Upload PDF files and save them locally.
- Ask questions about the content of the PDF.
- Receive context-aware responses generated by OpenAI's language model.
- Store chat history in MongoDB.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- MongoDB instance (local or cloud-based like MongoDB Atlas)
- OpenAI API key

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PDF-LLM.git
    cd PDF-LLM
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and add your OpenAI API key:
    ```env
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
    ```

### Usage
1. Run the Streamlit app:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`.

3. Enter your OpenAI API key, email, and password in the sidebar.

4. Upload a PDF file and ask questions about its content.
