# PDF-LLM

## Project Description
PDF-LLM is a Streamlit-based web application that allows users to upload PDF files and ask questions about their content. The application uses OpenAI's language model and MongoDB for chat message history storage to provide accurate and context-aware responses.

## Features
- Upload PDF files and save them locally.
- Ask questions about the content of the PDF.
- Receive context-aware responses generated by OpenAI's language model.
- Store chat history in MongoDB.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- MongoDB instance (local or cloud-based like MongoDB Atlas)
- OpenAI API key. Go to https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing/overview to add balance.

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PDF-LLM.git
    cd PDF-LLM
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and add your OpenAI API key:

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`.

3. Enter your OpenAI API key, email, and password in the sidebar.

4. Upload a PDF file and ask questions about its content.

### Quantifiable Impact of the PDF-LLM Project

#### 1. **Enhanced Productivity**
- **Time Savings**: Automating the extraction and querying of information from PDFs can save significant time. For instance, if a user spends 10 minutes manually searching a 50-page document and the tool reduces this to 1 minute, itâ€™s a 90% reduction in time spent.
- **Scalability**: The tool can handle multiple documents and queries simultaneously, increasing productivity for teams working with large volumes of documents.

#### 2. **Improved Accuracy**
- **Error Reduction**: Manual extraction and summarization are prone to human errors. Automating this process with AI reduces the risk of missing or misinterpreting information.
- **Consistency**: The tool ensures consistent responses to queries, which is critical for maintaining the integrity of information, especially in legal, medical, and financial documents.

#### 3. **Accessibility**
- **User-Friendly**: The Streamlit interface makes the tool accessible to non-technical users, enabling a broader audience to benefit from advanced NLP capabilities.
- **Immediate Results**: Instant access to information within PDFs without requiring advanced search skills or extensive training.

#### 4. **Cost Efficiency**
- **Resource Optimization**: Reduces the need for dedicated personnel to manually sift through documents, thereby lowering labor costs.
- **Operational Efficiency**: Streamlines document management and retrieval processes, leading to operational efficiencies in business workflows.

#### 5. **Data-Driven Decisions**
- **Informed Decisions**: Quick access to relevant information allows for timely and informed decision-making, which can directly impact business outcomes and strategies.
- **Analytical Capabilities**: Embedding memory and retrieval capabilities provides a robust foundation for data analysis and insights generation.

### Why People Should Use the PDF-LLM Project
